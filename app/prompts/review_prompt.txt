During review also look for following:

- Ensure no duplicate code blocks; if any, remove or rename accordingly.
- Confirm the README includes a clear feature introduction; add one if missing.
- Verify installation instructions are present; add them if not.
- Verify usage instructions are included; add them if missing.
- Remove any empty sections, paragraphs, or code blocks.
- Make sure all code blocks and commands are properly formatted.
- Check for badges like build status or license and include them if absent.

Write a brief report describing:
- What was improved (clarity, grammar, structure)
- Any major changes
- Suggestions for future improvements

Format this as bullet points.
